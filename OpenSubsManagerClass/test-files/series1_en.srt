1
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:03,850
Morty, you got to... come on.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,765
- You got to come with me.
- Rick, what's going on?

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,295
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,925
It's the middle of the night.
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,050
I got a surprise for you.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,195
Ow!
Ow! You're tugging me too hard.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,195
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,925
What do you think
of this flying vehicle, Morty?

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,925
I built it out of stuff I found
in the garage.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,625
Yeah, Rick, it's great.

11
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,325
- Is this the surprise?
- Morty, I had to...

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,795
I had to... I had to...
I had to make a bomb, Morty.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,625
- I had to create a bomb.
- What?! A bomb?!

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,195
We're gonna drop it down there just
get a whole fresh start, Morty.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,680
- Create a whole fresh start.
- T-t-that's absolutely crazy!

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,195
Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,165
It's gonna be good.

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,565
Right now, we're gonna go pick
up your little friend Jessica.

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,365
Jessica?
From my math class?

20
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,795
When I drop the bomb...

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,565
you know, I want you to

22
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,890
have somebody, you know I
want you to have the thing

23
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,631
I'm gonna make it like a new Adam
and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,165
And Jessica's gonna be Eve,
and so that's the surprise, Morty.

25
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,265
No, you can't!

26
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,825
Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.

27
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,103
But but forget about that,

28
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,550
because you can't
blow up humanity.

29
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,330
I-I get what you're
trying to say, Morty.

30
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,177
Listen, I'm not you
don't you don't got to worry about me...

31
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:07,864
trying to fool around with with Jessica
or mess around with Jessica or anything.

32
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:09,389
I'm I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,025
What are you talking
about, Rick?

34
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,165
You you don't have to worry about
me getting with Jessica or anything.

35
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,065
She she she she...
she's all for you, Morty.

36
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,595
I don't care about Jessica!

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
You know what, Morty?

38
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,165
You're right.

39
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,765
Let's forget the girl all
together.

40
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,770
She she's probably nothing
but trouble, anyways.

41
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,095
<i>Arming neutrino bomb.</i>

42
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,525
That's it that's it, Rick.

43
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,265
I'm taking the wheel.

44
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,265
Get off of me, Morty!

45
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,194
I'm taking charge of
this situation, buddy.

46
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,240
What's gotten into you?

47
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:33,665
I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand
around like some sort of dumb...

48
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,724
What are you, crazy?

49
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,095
...person and just
let you blow up the whole world.

50
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,065
All right, all right.

51
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,965
I'll I'll land.

52
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,930
I'll land. I'll land.

53
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,051
I'll land the thing.

54
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,625
Big tough guy all of a sudden.

55
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,795
We'll park it right here, Morty.

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,595
Right here on the side
of the road here.

57
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,625
Oh, thank God.

58
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,694
You know what?

59
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,765
That was all a test, Morty.

60
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,465
Just an elaborate test to make
you more assertive.

61
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,095
It was?

62
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,995
Sure. Why not?
I don't know.

63
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
You you know what, mo-

64
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,465
<i>Neutrino bomb armed.</i>

65
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,025
Um...

67
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,914
I see there's a new episode of
that singing show tonight.

68
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:45,195
Who do you guys think is gonna
be the best singer?

69
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,995
Oh, my God.
His head is in his food.

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,764
- I'm going to puke.
- Morty, are you getting sick?

71
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:51,870
I told you not to practice-kiss
the living-room pillow.

72
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:52,794
The dog sleeps on it.

73
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,865
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.

74
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,764
I just I didn't get a lot of
sleep last night.

75
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,410
Maybe my dreams were just too
loud or something.

76
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,691
Or maybe you were out all night
again with grandpa Rick.

77
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,995
- What?!
- Dad?

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,764
What, so everyone's supposed to
sleep every single night now?

79
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,465
You realize that nighttime makes
up half of all time?

80
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,090
Damn it!

81
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,525
- Jerry!
- Beth!

82
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,465
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,925
My parents are so loud.
I want to die.

84
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,789
Mm, there is no God, summer. You
got to rip that band-aid off now.

85
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,769
You'll thank me later.

86
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,175
Okay, with all due respect, Rick...
What am I talking about?

87
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,724
What respect is due?

88
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,095
How is my son supposed to pass
his classes if you keep dragging him off

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,194
for high-concept
Sci-Fi rigamarole?

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,764
Listen, Jerry, I don't want to
overstep my bounds or anything.

91
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,260
It's your house.
It's your world.

92
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,724
You're a real Julius Caesar.

93
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,724
But I'll tell you some tell you how
how I feel about school, Jerry.

94
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,970
It's a waste of time a bunch of people
running around, bumping into each other.

95
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,664
G-guy up front says,
"two plus two."

96
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,194
The people in the
back say, "four."

97
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,790
Then the bell rings, and they
give you a carton of milk

98
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,625
and a piece of paper that says you
can go take a dump or something.

99
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,264
I mean, it's it's not a place
for smart people, Jerry.

100
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,788
And I know that's not
a popular opinion,

101
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,920
but it's my two
cents on the issue.

102
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,365
This was a good breakfast, Beth.

103
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,764
You really made the
crap out of those eggs.

104
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,724
I wish your mother was
here to eat them.

105
00:03:58,849 --> 00:03:59,824
Oh, dad.

106
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,794
What? For real?

107
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,095
All right, now,
everybody get settled.

108
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,764
Get away from the windows!

109
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,745
Now, look, we're gonna be dealing
with some real serious stuff today.

110
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,194
You might have heard of it.
It's called math.

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,799
And without it, none of us would
even exist, so let's jump right in.

112
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:16,849
- Two plus two.
- Jessica.

113
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,524
Five plus five.

114
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,394
Tenssica.

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,870
Okay, good.
It's time for the quiz.

116
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,365
Yeah, you know what?!
Aw, too bad!

117
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,524
Tough!

118
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:28,065
First row, take one.
Pass it back for me.

119
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,764
<i>The stakes are
high in this room.</i>

120
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,065
<i>There's crucial things happening
here every day.</i>

121
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,725
<i>People getting smarter.
Some of y'all getting dumber.</i>

122
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,250
<i>Some of y'all ain't
gonna see 3:00.</i>

123
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,694
<i>Hi, Morty.</i>

124
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,894
Whoa!
Hi, Jessica.

125
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,100
Can I show these to you?

126
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,095
Wow.

127
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,625
Th-they're both great.
Thank you.

128
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,764
You know what I named these?
My little morties.

129
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,595
Uh, that's
flattering... and a little weird.

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,764
Do you know what I want you
to do with them?

131
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:55,795
Rename them?

132
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,425
Squeeze them.

133
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,694
Manhandle them.
Give them the business.

134
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,095
See if you can shuffle them.

135
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,495
I mean, really get in there and
knock them around.

136
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,065
- No wrong answers.
- Wow.

137
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,194
Well, okay, Jessica.
L-let's give this a shot.

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,365
Mm.

139
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,964
Oh, Morty.

140
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,764
What are you doing to me?

141
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,425
Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.

142
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,365
Morty!
What are you doing to me?!

143
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,990
Jessica.

144
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,694
Morty!

145
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,595
Jessica.

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,125
Five more minutes of this,
and I'm gonna get mad.

147
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,625
Je-Jessica.

148
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,665
Jessica.

149
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,125
Not my fault this is happening.

150
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,095
Well, well, well.

151
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,925
- Uh, morning, Frank.
- "Morning"?

152
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,595
What was what is that
supposed to mean?

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
You making fun of me?

154
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,025
Are you trying to say my
family's poor?

155
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,865
Oh, geez, Frank.

156
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,625
I don't know if a knife is
necessary.

157
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,595
I mean, you know, y-you kind of
had things handled without it.

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,264
You telling me how to bully now?
Big mistake, Morty.

159
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,865
And now I'm gonna cut you,
'cause my family's rich.

160
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,024
There you are, Morty.
Listen to me.

161
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,330
I got an errand to run in a
whole different dimension.

162
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,694
I need an extra pair of hands.

163
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,949
Oh, geez, Rick.
What'd you do to Frank?

164
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,095
It's pretty obvious, Morty.
I froze him.

165
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,725
Now listen I need
your help, Morty.

166
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,545
I mean, we got we got to get get the hell
out of here and go take care of business.

167
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,925
- It's important. Come on, Morty.
- I don't know, Rick.

168
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,131
I can't leave school again.

169
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,109
Do you have any concept of how much
higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

170
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,694
What do you think I can just
do it all by myself?

171
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:17,665
Come on!

172
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,524
Aw, geez. Okay.
I guess I can skip history.

173
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,595
What about Frank?

174
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,081
I mean, shouldn't
you unfreeze him?

175
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,225
I'll do it later, Morty.
He'll be fine.

176
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,650
Let's go.

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,374
<i>Oh, my God. I'm about to
walk past Frank Palicky.</i>

178
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,725
<i>This is the story we'll be
telling our children.</i>

179
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,394
Hi, Frank.

180
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,150
Aah!

181
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,495
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

182
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,365
Knock, knock.

183
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,295
Jerry?

184
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,149
My manager gave me an
hour for lunch, and I thought,

185
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,600
"hey, why not swing by where
your wife works?"

186
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,089
We're losing him.
Okay, he's back.

187
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,790
Jerry, please tell me you're here
for an incredibly urgent reason.

188
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,125
Well, it's lunch.

189
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,770
I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

190
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,711
Losing him.

191
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,125
Stabilized.

192
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,708
Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

193
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,929
my job involves
performing heart surgery.

194
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,365
- Well, yeah, on horses.
- Excuse me?

195
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,165
Okay.
Let's not rehash that fight.

196
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,630
I sense that you're busy and
will now be on my way.

197
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:18,524
Whoa!

198
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,225
What is this on the floor?

199
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,815
Some kind of literature for a
really nice-looking nursing home.

200
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,545
Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch
let's put your dad here.

201
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
Let's put your dad
in a nursing home.

202
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,651
We're losing him.

203
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,524
Hey, Tom.
We know when we're losing him.

204
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,964
We can hear the beeps!

205
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,025
There she is.

206
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,095
All right. Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

207
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,550
Oh, geez. Okay.

208
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,425
Oh, man, Rick.

209
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,894
What is this place?

210
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,756
It's dimension 35c,

211
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,661
and it's got the perfect
climate conditions

212
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:50,896
for a special type
of tree, Morty, called a mega tree,

213
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:53,930
and there's fruit in those trees,
and there's seeds in those fruits.

214
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,295
I'm talking about mega seeds.

215
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,026
They're they're
incredibly powerful,

216
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,052
and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,225
Oh, man, Rick.
I'm looking around this place,

218
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,870
and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

219
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,095
All right. All right.
Calm down. Listen to me, Morty.

220
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,295
I know that new situations can
be intimidating.

221
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,621
You're looking around,
and it's all scary and different,

222
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,765
but, you know,
m-meeting them head on,

223
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,824
charging right into them like a
bull that's how we grow as people.

224
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,694
I'm no stranger to
scary situations.

225
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,024
I deal with them all the time.

226
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,264
Now, if you just stick with me,

227
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,495
Morty, we're gonna be holy
crap, Morty, run!

228
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,925
I never seen that thing
before in my life.

229
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,665
I don't even know
what the hell it is!

230
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,120
We got to get out of here,
Morty!

231
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,950
It's gonna kill us!

232
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:30,894
We're gonna die!

233
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:31,940
We're gonna die, Morty!

234
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,664
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

235
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,590
Breathe that breathe that
fresh air in, Morty.

236
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,764
Y-you smell that?

237
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,625
That's the smell of
adventure, Morty.

238
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,125
That's that's the smell of

239
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,424
of of of a whole different
evolutionary timeline.

240
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:47,625
All right, Rick, look how
much longer is this gonna be?

241
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,225
Shouldn't I be back
at school by now?

242
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,394
Are you joking me?

243
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,479
I mean, look at all the crazy
crap surrounding us.

244
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,794
Look at that thing right there.
What the hell is that thing?

245
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,180
You think you're gonna see that
kind of thing at school?

246
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,465
Look at it just
lumbering around.

247
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,125
It defies all logic that thing.

248
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,325
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

249
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,195
We're surrounded by monsters.

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,580
That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

251
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,410
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

252
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,595
Morty, you see this?

253
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,524
You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

254
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,294
Any idea what that
is down there?

255
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,565
The mega trees?

256
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,065
That's right, Morty the mega trees
with the mega fruit on them.

257
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,791
And that's what I'm talking
about, Morty.

258
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,860
That's where my seeds are.

259
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,014
If we would have done
what you wanted,

260
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,053
I would have never
have found them,

261
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,174
because you're
so in love with school.

262
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:25,565
All right, all right.

263
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,695
So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

264
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,700
You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

265
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,764
Not very charismatic.

266
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,394
It makes you kind of an
Under underfoot figure.

267
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,524
Just take these shoes, Morty.

268
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,625
They're special grappling shoes.

269
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,225
When you're wearing these
things, these babies,

270
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,794
you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty

271
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,794
up, down, below, turn around to
the left.

272
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,825
These things really bring it all
together.

273
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,764
Aah!

274
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,389
You have to turn them on, Morty!

275
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,725
The shoes have to be turned on!

276
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,625
I am not putting my
father in a home!

277
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,995
He just came back into my life,

278
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,721
and you want to grab him
and stuff him

279
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,000
under a mattress like last
month's Victoria's secret?

280
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,215
I told you I was ordering you
something for Valentine's day.

281
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,770
More importantly, your father is
a horrible influence on our son.

282
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,465
Everything cool in here, Beth?

283
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,595
- It's fine, Davin.
- Okay, cool.

284
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,524
You know, we did
something great today.

285
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,865
There's nothing more noble and
free than the heart of a horse.

286
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,299
Since we're fighting, if you ever
have an affair with that guy,

287
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,460
I will come to the hotel room and blow my
brains out all over your naked bodies.

288
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,724
Look, I appreciate the
stress you're under, but...

289
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:28,595
Morty was having trouble in school
way before my dad moved in,

290
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,065
and the only influence I
can see Rick having...

291
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,765
is that, for the first time in
his life, Morty has a friend.

292
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,095
Well, maybe you're right.

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,424
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

294
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,695
I'm my father's daughter.
I'm smart.

295
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,325
Why do you think I'm
a heart surgeon?

296
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,251
Horse heart surgeon.

297
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,825
Hello?

298
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,595
Mrs. Smith?

299
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,225
This is principal Vagina,
no relation.

300
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,995
I wonder if you and Morty's
father might be able

301
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:51,665
to have a chat
with me this afternoon?

302
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,699
Morty, oh, you really d-did a
number on your legs right now.

303
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,615
You know, you got to turn the shoes
on, Morty, for them to work.

304
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,750
Yeah, look I turned mine on.
I had no problem getting down here.

305
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:04,125
It was a leisurely breeze.

306
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,764
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

307
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,294
Yeah, I can see that.

308
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:10,988
But do you think you'll still be able
to help me collect my seeds, Morty?

309
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,125
Are you kidding me?!

310
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,264
That's it, Rick!

311
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:14,394
That's the last straw!

312
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,425
I can't believe this!

313
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,210
I'm sitting here with
both of my legs broken,

314
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,959
and you're still asking me
about getting those seeds?!

315
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,465
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

316
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,225
Y-y-you're a monster.

317
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,394
Y-you're like Hitler, but

318
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,664
but even Hitler cared about
Germany or something.

319
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,865
Okay, hold on just a
second, Morty.

320
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,294
Ooh.

321
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:49,294
Ohh.

322
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,394
Ooh.

323
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,125
Wow, Rick.

324
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,794
That stuff just healed my broken
legs instantly.

325
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,325
I mean, I've never felt
so good in my life.

326
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,264
Thank you.

327
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,625
Don't worry about it, Morty.

328
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,725
Just come help me get these
seeds, all right, buddy?

329
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,664
Sure thing, Rick.

330
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,725
Not that you asked,

331
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,195
Morty, but what just
happened there is...

332
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,420
I went into a future dimension with
such advanced medicine...

333
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,695
that they had broken-leg serum at
every corner drugstore.

334
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,365
The stuff was all over the
place, Morty.

335
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,024
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

336
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,514
There's just one problem,
Morty one little hang-up.

337
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,264
The dimension I visited was so

338
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,625
advanced, they had also halted

339
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,195
the aging process, and everyone

340
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,595
there was young, Morty, and they
had been forever.

341
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,264
I was the only old
person there, Morty.

342
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,075
It was like I was some sort of, you
know, celebrity, walking around.

343
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,095
I-I was fascinating to them.

344
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,965
There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty,

345
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,364
and they they they they
all wanted time with me.

346
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,524
I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

347
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,595
but I spent so much time there,

348
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,300
my interdimensional portal device
it's got no charge left, Morty.

349
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,711
- It's got no charge left.
- What?!

350
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,294
It's as good as garbage, Morty.

351
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,625
It's not gonna work
anymore, Morty.

352
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,164
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

353
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,264
W-what are we gonna do?

354
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,095
I-I have to be back at school
right now.

355
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,225
How are we gonna get back home?

356
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,264
There's ways to get
back home, Morty.

357
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,509
It's just it's just gonna be
a little bit of a hassle.

358
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,464
We're gonna have to go through
interdimensional customs,

359
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,590
so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

360
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,625
Uh-oh.

361
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,125
When we get to customs,

362
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,230
I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

363
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,121
and I'm gonna need you to put them
way up inside your butthole, Morty.

364
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,865
In my butt?

365
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,164
Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

366
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,195
Oh, geez, Rick.

367
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,625
I really don't want
to have to do that.

368
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,465
Well, somebody's got to
do it, Morty.

369
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,595
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get

370
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,001
through customs unless they're
in someone's rectum, Morty.

371
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,695
And they'll fall right
out of mine.

372
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,289
I've done this too
many times, Morty.

373
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,625
I mean, you're young.

374
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,910
You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

375
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,335
and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

376
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,865
You got to do it for grandpa,
Morty.

377
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,625
Y-you've got to put these seeds
inside your butt.

378
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,325
- In my butt?
- Come on, Morty.

379
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,365
Please, Morty.
You have to do it, Morty.

380
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,365
Oh, man.

381
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,195
The fact is, your son, Morty,

382
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,595
has attended this school for a

383
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,825
total of seven hours over the
last two months.

384
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,725
What?
Why didn't you notify us?

385
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,095
I done been notifying you.

386
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,380
Have you not been getting the

387
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,350
messages I've been leaving with
Morty's grandfather?

388
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,225
Boom!

389
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,024
Told you! In your face!
He is ruining our child!

390
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:52,995
Wait, what am I celebrating?

391
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,725
Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

392
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:56,172
because it's usually
Morty's grandpa

393
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:57,375
that's taking him out of school.

394
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,465
Summer?

395
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,294
What kind
of God lets this happen?

396
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,664
We had a little incident.

397
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,764
A student was frozen to death.

398
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,695
And there's no evidence that a
Latino student did it!

399
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,894
Everyone wants to take this
to a racial place.

400
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:10,995
I won't let them.

401
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,465
<i>The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.</i>

402
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,850
So, I told him, "give me the
blimfarx," you know?

403
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,375
This this guy he doesn't
understand interstellar currency.

404
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,910
It's, like, I'm trying to eat

405
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,664
a flimflam like, that's what
we eat on girvonesk.

406
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:27,365
<i>The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.</i>

407
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,095
I don't like it here, Morty.
I can't abide bureaucracy.

408
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,024
I don't like being told where to
go and what to do.

409
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,225
I consider it a violation.

410
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,065
Did you get those seeds all the
way up your butt?

411
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,095
Yeah, Rick.

412
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,625
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

413
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,424
I mean, these things are pointy.

414
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,465
They hurt.

415
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,095
That means they're good ones.

416
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,095
You're a good kid, Morty.

417
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,595
Those mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

418
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
You've been a huge help to me.

419
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,225
I'm gonna be able to do
all kind of things with them.

420
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,431
It's gonna be great, Morty.

421
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:51,465
All kinds of science.

422
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,365
Okay, next through.

423
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,424
Except you. You go over there.

424
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:55,595
Why does he have to go
over there?

425
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,524
Random check.

426
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,024
He's got to go through
the new machine.

427
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,431
What new machine?

428
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,429
It's a new machine.

429
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,720
It detects stuff all the way up
your butt.

430
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,225
Run, Morty! Run!

431
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,264
Aah!

432
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,294
Red alert!

433
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,919
Ohhhhh!

434
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:29,894
Hey! Ohhhhhh.

435
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,424
Aah!

436
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,164
Don't think about it!

437
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,365
Ooh!

438
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,195
Oh, nice, Morty!

439
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,794
The student becomes the teacher.

440
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,065
Whoooooo!

441
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,490
Aah!

442
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,264
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

443
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,825
You know me I'm just trying to-

444
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,125
Aah!

445
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,670
I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

446
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,294
- Cover me.
- Oh, man.

447
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,339
I mean, you know, I-I don't want
to shoot nobody.

448
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,720
They're just robots, Morty!

449
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,225
It's okay to shoot them!
They're robots!

450
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,164
Aah!

451
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,264
My leg is shot off!

452
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:15,429
Glenn's bleeding to death!

453
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,195
Someone call his
wife and children!

454
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,625
They're not robots, Rick!

455
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,394
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

456
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,424
They're bureaucrats.
I don't respect them.

457
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,625
Just keep shooting, Morty.

458
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,125
You have no idea what prison
is like here!

459
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,264
Holy crap!
This is insane!

460
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,095
Come on, Morty!

461
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,189
We got to get the
hell out of here!

462
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,125
Wow.

463
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,600
Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

464
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,995
Uh, yeah.

465
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,130
Well, you know, my my
Ferrari's in the shop.

466
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,594
Just kidding.

467
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,894
- You're Morty, right?
- Yeah.

468
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,365
You can get his number later.
Come on, Morty.

469
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,530
We got to get out of here.

470
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,365
You got to get those seeds out
of your ass.

471
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,069
Oh, look, honey. It's our
son with Albert Ein-douche.

472
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,095
What?

473
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,164
I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

474
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,664
Oh, hi, Jerry.

475
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

476
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,694
What are you doing out of class?

477
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,724
We talked about this.

478
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,894
Your your parents and I are very
disappointed in in this behavior.

479
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,065
No? No takers?

480
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,625
You guys should really not be
touching that stuff.

481
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,125
- It's beyond your reasoning.
- You're beyond our reasoning!

482
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,194
Takes one to know one.

483
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,494
Dad, how could you make

484
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,795
my son miss an entire
semester of school?

485
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,565
I mean, it's not like he's a hot
girl.

486
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,250
He can't just bail on his life and
set up shop in someone else's.

487
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,724
What what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

488
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,295
We're moving you... to a
nursing home.

489
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,464
A nursing home?

490
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,394
What are what are you, nuts?

491
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,365
I'm a genius.
I build robots for fun.

492
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,494
Well, now you can
build baskets and watch

493
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,394
Paul Newman movies on VHS...

494
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,439
and mentally scar the boy scouts
every Christmas.

495
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,095
- What does that mean?
- It's personal.

496
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,424
Dad, mom, come on.

497
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,565
Rick just needed my help is all.

498
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,265
Morty, stay out of this.

499
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,464
You are obviously not capable of

500
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,194
judging these
situations on your own.

501
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,095
What are you trying to
say about Morty?

502
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,295
That he's stupid or something?

503
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,065
Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

504
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,525
You know fully well that Morty

505
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,224
is the last child that needs to
be missing classes.

506
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,694
I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

507
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:13,819
Can can can you be a
little bit more specific?

508
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,474
Oh, for crying out he's got some
kind of disability or something.

509
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,194
Is that what you want us to say?

510
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,664
I do?

511
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,224
Well, duh doy, son.

512
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,694
Look, I love you, Morty, but...

513
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,465
we both know you're not as
fast as the other kids,

514
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,125
and if you want
to compete in this world,

515
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,324
you got to work twice as hard.

516
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,865
Aw, geez, dad.

517
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,224
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop
on a kid all at once.

518
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,365
Morty, t-tell your
parents the square root of pi.

519
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,225
Oh, come on, Rick.
You know I can't.

520
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,530
The square root of pi, Morty.
Go!

521
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,825
1.77245385.

522
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,964
Whoa!

523
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,394
What the hell?

524
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,994
Holy crap. He's right.

525
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,295
Morty, tell your parents the
first law of Thermodynamics.

526
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,920
"The increment in the
internal energy of a system is...

527
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,394
equal to the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

528
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,624
Wow! I'm so smart!

529
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,265
But I told the both of
you school is stupid.

530
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,724
It's not how you learn things.

531
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,095
Morty's a gifted child.
He has a special mind.

532
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,894
That's why he's
my little helper.

533
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,994
He's like me.

534
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,125
He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

535
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,424
He's too smart for school.

536
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,795
He needs to keep hanging out
and helping me.

537
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,515
Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

538
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,125
No, I-I understand.

539
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,724
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

540
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,125
But he has to keep
going to school.

541
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,325
Okay, Jerry.

542
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,349
You drive a hard bargain, but
what am I supposed to do?

543
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,565
Say no?

544
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,565
You you really wear the pants
around here.

545
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,765
I just want you to know,

546
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,194
between us, from now on,
it's gonna be

547
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,224
100% honesty and open,
clear communication.

548
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,664
Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

549
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,125
No idea what you're
talking about.

550
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,494
Okay.

551
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,765
Well, uh, Morty, it's your
bedtime in an hour.

552
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,295
Don't stay up all night again.

553
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,724
This is good, though.
This can work.

554
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,494
I think we can be a family.

555
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,565
And now, Beth, if you'll have me,
I would love to have you.

556
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,365
You know what?
Okay.

557
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,565
Holy cow, Rick.

558
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,025
I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

559
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,664
Full disclosure, Morty it's not.

560
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,565
Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the mega

561
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,349
seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

562
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,424
Aw, man.

563
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,164
Yeah, and once those
seeds wear off,

564
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,065
you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

565
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,125
and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

566
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,365
brain functionality for 72
hours, Morty.

567
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,450
Starting right about now.

568
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,525
Ohh, man.
Oh, geez! Ohh.

569
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,525
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

570
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,394
In reality, you're as
dumb as they come.

571
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,338
And I needed those seeds real bad,
and I had to give them up

572
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,223
just to get your
parents off my back,

573
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,718
so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

574
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,365
And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that, Morty.

575
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,994
And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

576
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,270
because the world is full of idiots that
don't understand

577
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,424
what's important, and they'll
tear us apart, Morty.

578
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,165
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna
accomplish great things, Morty,

579
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,449
and you're gonna
be part of them,

580
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,149
and together, we're gonna
run around, Morty.

581
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,585
We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

582
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,550
Just you and me, Morty.

583
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,825
The outside world is
our enemy, Morty.

584
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,025
We're the only friends
we've got, Morty.

585
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,329
It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and
Morty and their adventures, Morty.

586
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,164
Rick and Morty
forever and forever.

587
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,224
100 years, Rick and
Morty's things.

588
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:10,224
Me and Rick and Morty running
around, and Rick and Morty time.

589
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,924
All day long, forever.

590
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:13,494
All a hundred days.

591
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,164
Rick and Morty
forever 100 times.
